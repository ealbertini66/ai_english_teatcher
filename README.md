# English Level Assessment and Personalized Study Plan Creator

## Project Description

This project is designed to help students assess their English language proficiency and create a personalized study plan. It uses a virtual English teacher to evaluate the student's level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced) based on their responses to multiple-choice questions. The study plan is tailored to the student's level, learning goals (e.g., for work, travel, understanding music/movies, gaming), age, and available study time per week.

## Features

*   **English Level Assessment:** Evaluates the student's English level through a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty.
*   **Personalized Study Plan:** Generates a study plan based on the student's English level, learning goals, age, and available study time.
*   **Two Communication Modes:**
    *   **Full English:** All communication with the student is in English.
    *   **Half English:** The initial assessment and exercises are in English, while explanations and instructions are in Portuguese.
*   **Virtual Teacher Persona:** Interacts with the student as "Professor Eve," an engaging and supportive virtual English teacher.
*   **Text-to-Speech:** Uses gTTS to provide audio instructions and questions, enhancing the learning experience.
*   **Integration with Gemini AI:** Leverages Google's Gemini AI model for generating responses and personalized study plans.
*   **Adjustable difficulty:** Tests the student with questions from basic to advanced, adjusting the level depending on the studentÂ´s answers
*  **Google Userdata Authentication:** Uses Google userdata to store your private API_KEY

## Technologies Used

*   Python
*   Google Colab
*   `google-genai` (for interacting with Google's Gemini AI model)
*   `gTTS` (for text-to-speech)
*   `IPython` (for displaying images and audio in Colab)
*   `colorama` (for colored text output in the console)

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Open in Google Colab:** Open the project notebook in Google Colab.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Run the following commands in a Colab cell to install the required libraries:

```bash
!pip install google-genai
!pip install gTTS
!pip install IPython
```

3.  **Set up Google API Key:**

    *   Create an API key at the [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
    *   In Google Colab, go to *Tools > Secrets*.
    *   Create a secret with the name `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and paste your API key as the value.
    *   The project code will fetch the API key using the following:

```python
import os
from google.colab import userdata
os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'] = userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
```

## Usage

1.  **Run the Notebook:** Execute the cells in the Colab notebook in the order they appear.
2.  **Interact with the Virtual Teacher:** Follow the prompts provided by the virtual English teacher.
3.  **Answer the Questions:** Respond to the multiple-choice questions to assess your English level.
4.  **Receive Personalized Study Plan:** After completing the assessment, you will have the option to receive a personalized study plan based on your level, goals, age, and available study time.

## Project Structure

*   **Code Cells:** The Colab notebook contains code cells with Python code for:
    *   Installing dependencies
    *   Setting up the virtual teacher
    *   Defining functions for text-to-speech, displaying images, and interacting with the Gemini AI model
    *   Implementing the English level assessment
    *   Generating the personalized study plan

*   **Markdown Cells:** The notebook also contains markdown cells with explanations, instructions, and formatting.

## Code Explanation

*   **`mode_identify()`:**  Determines whether to proceed in "full\_english" or "half\_english" mode based on the user's understanding of an initial English prompt.
*   **`texto_para_audio(texto, idioma)`:** Converts text to audio using gTTS.
*   **`print_assistent_response(response)`:** Prints the virtual assistant's responses with a specific color formatting.
*   **`chat_config`:** Defines the system instructions for the Gemini AI model, specifying its role as an English teacher and the evaluation process.
*   The rest of the code handles the interaction with the user, the English level assessment, and the generation of the personalized study plan.
